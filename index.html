          <p>Lorem lpsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
              Lorem lpsum has been <br>the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
              when an unknown printer took a gallery <br> of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
              It has survived not only five centuries, but <br> also the leap into electronic typepesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
              It was popularised in <br> the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem lpsum passages,
              and more recently <br> with  desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem lpsum.<br><br>
              It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when<br> looking at its layout.
              The point of using Lorem lpsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution<br> of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here' making it look like readable English.
              Many dasktop <br> publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem lpsum as their default model text,and <br> a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
              Various version have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br> sometimes on purpose(injected humor and the like).

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem lpsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distruction of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here' making it look like readable English. Many dasktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem lpsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various version have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose(injected humor and the like).<br><br> 

            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem lpsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 year old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney college in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem lpsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem lpsum comes from section 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem ,lpsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
